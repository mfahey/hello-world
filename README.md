# hello-world
Initialize this repository with a README.
I am trying to learn about Git/Github.  I should know more about Git at this stage in my career.
I am fool in the eyes of junior developers.
Wish I did more technical Java in my career. 
To much of different things and not enough of one.  Probably wasted time no focusing on career.
